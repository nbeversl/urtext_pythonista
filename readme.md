# Urtext Implementation for iOS using [Pythonista](https://omz-software.com/pythonista/)

## This repository

This repository is an implementation of [Urtext](https://urtext.co) for **iOS** in the form of a Python library that binds Urtext functionality to native editor views, a custom keyboard, and syntax highlighting.

## What Urtext Is

Urtext /ˈʊrtekst/ is an open-source library for plaintext writing, research, documentation, knowledge bases, journaling, Zettelkasten, project/personal organization, note taking, a lightweight database substitute, or any other writing or information management that can be done in text format.

The core library has no user interface and requires a text editor implementation (such as the one in this repository).

## Installation

There is an [One-Step Install or Update](https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_pythonista_install_or_update) script that can be run from within [Pythonista](https://omz-software.com/pythonista/). It will install this library and all its dependencies, including Urtext.
